Narrator: Rubik the Amazing Cube ran from September of 1984 to September of 1984. It was produced by Ruby Spears. It was on TV as part of the pac man Rubik the Amazing Cube hour on ABC. Ruby Spears, the creator of the show, is a California based production company that specializes in animation. It was founded in 1977 by Jill Ruby and Ken Spears, they had both started out as sound editors at Hannah Barbara and would eventually start writing stories on shows like The Herculoids and Space Ghosts. IN the late 60s, they were tasked with developing a cartoon for Saturday morning that was mystery based- the end result would be the iconic Scooby Doo Where Are You. Eventually they would depart from Hannah Barbara and would create the Ruby Spears studio. A year later, it was purchased by Film Ways Television and then in 1981, it was sold to Taft Broadcasting and became a sister company to Hannah Barbara which brings everything back together. Other characters and shows that Ruby Spears would create include Fang Face, Plastic Man, the 80s version of Alvin and the Chipmunks and Thundaa the Barbarian. Later stuff included the Superman Series and the MegaMan cartoon series.

We now return with Rubik the Amazing Cube 

In the show Rubik, this magical cube fell out of the Stage Coach of an Evil Magician and with the help of three siblings who could magically put this thing together at super fast speeds, they were Abel to harness Rubik’s innate magical ability and help keep the Rubik out of the hands of the evil magician. The better episodes are when they are dealing with the magician, but there are episodes where they encounter bullies.. and normal sort of adventures like that. Now if you have a magical cube that can do just about anything, you should have no problems. But him being the Rubik’s Cube, all you have to do is casually drop him and he gets completely scrambled so that you cannot do anything about it, and I cannot stress how frustrating I found it that these kids were so good at solving it when I couldn’t even solve two sides… I think in one episode even an animal was able to solve it, and it really bugged me but it kept me focused- eye on the prize. One of the cool things about Rubik the amazing cube is that the three siblings- Carlos, Lisa and Reynaldo Rodriguez are all of Hispanic-origin and it is one of the first shows, if not the first children’s show to have all the main characters be of Hispanic extraction. And we will talk a little about the inclusion of Menudo and the theme song choice a little bit later. First we will talk a little bit about the cast. Michael Bell voiced Reynaldo, Angela Moya played Marla… besides voice work she is probably best known for her work in the films Gleaming the Cube and The Forbidden Dance. Jennifer Legarda played Lisa, not a tremendous amount of information on her, but Rubik the Amazing Cube seems like the high water mark in her career; although she was also in Buddy Buddy in 1981. Michael Saucedo was Carlos. Saucedo’s also a musician and a soap opera actor. Now I might know him best for his work on Rubik the Amazing Cube but if you are a Soap Opera fan, he played Juan Santiago on General Hospital from 1999-2001. The voice of Rubrik was provided by Ron Palillo who was an American actor who passed away in 2012. He was Arnold Horshack on the sit-com Welcome Back Kotter from 1975 to 1979. He had a very distinct voice, not what boy will hear in Rubik the Amazing Cube, to create the voice of Rubik they took his voice and altered it some to give it that high pitch sound so I imagine if I had encountered Ron on the street I would have said “Hey do the voice of Rubik” and he would have put his hand over his eyes and said “Uh, not another one, cant do the voice kid, but I can do Horshack” and that would have been really cool too… “Oooh, ooh mr kotter.” 
A lot of other people contributed great voice work to this including Jack Delione, Laurey Fasso, Bob Holt, Press McNeal, John Stevenson, Allen Young and Janet Waldo who I interviewed for the Jetson Podcast if you want more information about her. Now, with a little bit more about why should I know these people is Vic Sage with “Why Should I know This Person.” 

Introduction music begins to play….piano instrumental
