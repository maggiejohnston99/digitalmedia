Video Description: <br>
A video is taken of a young blonde haired boy, in a blue and white checked outfit standing in the middle of a living room talking to his mother, Sarah, about the bug he has found.
The camera shows Riggs, the young boy, and he raises his hands to his eyes describing the bug he has just found. <br>
     Riggs states “it’s a big bug.” He opens his palm, putting his fingers apart to symbolize the size of the bug as he says “I can see it.”Riggs leans forward onto the couch where his mother is seated. <br>
Sarah replies “I don’t want to see it because I am scared of bugs.” <br>
Stuttering over his words, Riggs mumbles “bugs… it’s nice.” As he says the word nice, he squints his left eye closed, placing out his left hand as to explain his theory. <br>
Sarah says, “oh it’s nice?” <br>
Riggs responds “Ya, you actually see it cuz it’s nice.”<br>
“Oh… what kind of bug is it?” Sarah says<br>
The camera stays focused on Riggs where you see him giving a side eyed look at his mother, seemingly thinking of his response.<br>
Riggs responds, “It’s a big bug!” He says while placing his hands equal with his shoulders to show the size of the bug. <br>
Sarah says “Is it a lady bug?” <br>
To which Riggs responds “No, it’s a big bug.” <br>
The audience sees Sarah’s hand enter the scene and brush Riggs hair to the side as she asks “Is it a roly poly bug?” Then Sarah reaches out and grabs Riggs hand. <br>
Riggs says “No I yeah…uh, it’s a big bug! Come outside and see it!” Riggs has a big smile on his face as he is holding his mothers hand hoping she will come outside with him.<br>
Sarah responds “okay, um, will you catch it, catch it in your net?”<br>
Riggs lets go of his mothers hand and begins to walk away as he says “yeah”<br>
Sarah replies “okay” as Riggs exits the frame.<br>

Podcast: [04:08:00-10:08:00]<br>
Narrator: Rubik the Amazing Cube ran from September of 1984 to September of 1984. It was produced by Ruby Spears. It was on TV as part of the pac man Rubik the Amazing Cube hour on ABC. Ruby Spears, the creator of the show, is a California based production company that specializes in animation. It was founded in 1977 by Jill Ruby and Ken Spears, they had both started out as sound editors at Hannah Barbara and would eventually start writing stories on shows like The Herculoids and Space Ghosts. IN the late 60s, they were tasked with developing a cartoon for Saturday morning that was mystery based- the end result would be the iconic Scooby Doo Where Are You. Eventually they would depart from Hannah Barbara and would create the Ruby Spears studio. A year later, it was purchased by Film Ways Television and then in 1981, it was sold to Taft Broadcasting and became a sister company to Hannah Barbara which brings everything back together. Other characters and shows that Ruby Spears would create include Fang Face, Plastic Man, the 80s version of Alvin and the Chipmunks and Thundaa the Barbarian. Later stuff included the Superman Series and the MegaMan cartoon series. <br>

We now return with Rubik the Amazing Cube. <br>
<br>
In the show Rubik, this magical cube fell out of the Stage Coach of an Evil Magician and with the help of three siblings who could magically put this thing together at super fast speeds, they were Abel to harness Rubik’s innate magical ability and help keep the Rubik out of the hands of the evil magician. The better episodes are when they are dealing with the magician, but there are episodes where they encounter bullies.. and normal sort of adventures like that. Now if you have a magical cube that can do just about anything, you should have no problems. But him being the Rubik’s Cube, all you have to do is casually drop him and he gets completely scrambled so that you cannot do anything about it, and I cannot stress how frustrating I found it that these kids were so good at solving it when I couldn’t even solve two sides… I think in one episode even an animal was able to solve it, and it really bugged me but it kept me focused- eye on the prize. One of the cool things about Rubik the amazing cube is that the three siblings- Carlos, Lisa and Reynaldo Rodriguez are all of Hispanic-origin and it is one of the first shows, if not the first children’s show to have all the main characters be of Hispanic extraction. And we will talk a little about the inclusion of Menudo and the theme song choice a little bit later. First we will talk a little bit about the cast. Michael Bell voiced Reynaldo, Angela Moya played Marla… besides voice work she is probably best known for her work in the films Gleaming the Cube and The Forbidden Dance. Jennifer Legarda played Lisa, not a tremendous amount of information on her, but Rubik the Amazing Cube seems like the high water mark in her career; although she was also in Buddy Buddy in 1981. Michael Saucedo was Carlos. Saucedo’s also a musician and a soap opera actor. Now I might know him best for his work on Rubik the Amazing Cube but if you are a Soap Opera fan, he played Juan Santiago on General Hospital from 1999-2001. The voice of Rubrik was provided by Ron Palillo who was an American actor who passed away in 2012. He was Arnold Horshack on the sit-com Welcome Back Kotter from 1975 to 1979. He had a very distinct voice, not what boy will hear in Rubik the Amazing Cube, to create the voice of Rubik they took his voice and altered it some to give it that high pitch sound so I imagine if I had encountered Ron on the street I would have said “Hey do the voice of Rubik” and he would have put his hand over his eyes and said “Uh, not another one, cant do the voice kid, but I can do Horshack” and that would have been really cool too… “Oooh, ooh mr kotter.” 
A lot of other people contributed great voice work to this including Jack Delione, Laurey Fasso, Bob Holt, Press McNeal, John Stevenson, Allen Young and Janet Waldo who I interviewed for the Jetson Podcast if you want more information about her. Now, with a little bit more about why should I know these people is Vic Sage with “Why Should I know This Person.” <br>
