 Video Description: <br>
A video is taken of a young blonde haired boy, in a blue and white checked outfit standing in the middle of a living room talking to his mother, Sarah, about the bug he has found.
The camera shows Riggs, the young boy, and he raises his hands to his eyes describing the bug he has just found. <br>
     Riggs states “it’s a big bug.” He opens his palm, putting his fingers apart to symbolize the size of the bug as he says “I can see it.”Riggs leans forward onto the couch where his mother is seated. <br>
Sarah replies “I don’t want to see it because I am scared of bugs.” <br>
Stuttering over his words, Riggs mumbles “bugs… it’s nice.” As he says the word nice, he squints his left eye closed, placing out his left hand as to explain his theory. <br>
Sarah says, “oh it’s nice?” <br>
Riggs responds “Ya, you actually see it cuz it’s nice.”<br>
“Oh… what kind of bug is it?” Sarah says<br>
The camera stays focused on Riggs where you see him giving a side eyed look at his mother, seemingly thinking of his response.<br>
Riggs responds, “It’s a big bug!” He says while placing his hands equal with his shoulders to show the size of the bug. <br>
Sarah says “Is it a lady bug?” <br>
To which Riggs responds “No, it’s a big bug.” <br>
The audience sees Sarah’s hand enter the scene and brush Riggs hair to the side as she asks “Is it a roly poly bug?” Then Sarah reaches out and grabs Riggs hand. <br>
Riggs says “No I yeah…uh, it’s a big bug! Come outside and see it!” Riggs has a big smile on his face as he is holding his mothers hand hoping she will come outside with him.<br>
Sarah responds “okay, um, will you catch it, catch it in your net?”<br>
Riggs lets go of his mothers hand and begins to walk away as he says “yeah”<br>
Sarah replies “okay” as Riggs exits the frame.<br>
